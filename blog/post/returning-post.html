        <p>
          It's been some time since I have written a post on here, which I feel is partially a good thing. This summer I've been really connecting to my city and the beautiful amazing people here. I finally feel like I am home. This means, however, that I feel less connected with this online home I've created. I feel like that's okay though.<br>

          I think I want to write about more local/personal things. I know not many Ottawa folks will be on here, but I love this city and should be writing about what I love.
