          Recently I've been playing more music and it's been lovely, just wanted to share.<br>

          I've been off work for a couple weeks and in that time I have dusted off my guitar, put more effort into my violin, and attended many open mics in my city. It's been so amazing to reconnect with this aspect of myself, and to meet other musicians nearby. I think I am almost ready to play at an open mic myself too (may share here how that goes).<br>

          I know not everyone has much time in their life to stay connected with their musical side, but I really encourage you to take your instrument out and jam for a bit if you haven't in a while. It's been super healing for me at least.<br>

          And if you say you "aren't musical", you're probably wrong! >:D Everyone can do something, and playing music is such an amazing time, it's not worth missing out on. Even blazing the radio and singing along counts in my book so go do that you musical bastard you. You'll sound amazing I'm sure.
